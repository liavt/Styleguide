# Functions

Functions follow the same rules as variables, which is camelCase.

ALL functions follow this rule, even static functions or member functions.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="C++" %}
```text
class Foo {
public:
    void runNarwhal();
}

int getVersion();
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Java" %}
```text
public static void runsSomeWoawvering();
private int getHolesInWall();
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Macros follow the same rules as a [constant](constants.md)

Functions should ALWAYS be some sort of verb.

Use getters and setters effectively to achieve this.
