# Changes on a Whim

We all know that feeling. That feeling when you are thinking of a new feature and are getting really excited to add it and see it in action. It's fun to just add a bunch of cool features, but it is imperative that EVERY THING YOU ADD IS TESTED.

Even by adding 1 minor line of code, you must test the whole function again.

If you want to add cool prototype features, you can create a new branch called `unstable` and push to there. Once it is tested and proven to be 100% working, merge with `master`.
